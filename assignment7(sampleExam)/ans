Problem4

3. print only numbers

Problem5

def cubeVolume(sideLength):
    volume = sideLength ** 3
    return volume

    volume = cubeVolume(10)
    print("The volume is: %d"%volume)

main()ÃŸ


Problem6
-What is a class?
It's kind of base. You can use the class again and again by other variable


-What is an instance and how it is different from a class?


-What is the scope of a variable?


-What is a static variable?
Static Variable is impossible to change the variable again. It doesn't assign other things again.

-What is an object reference?
Object is kind of parts. If class is human, objects are eyes, hands, legs, nose, mouth, etc...
If class is a car, objects are colour, kind, brand, price, etc...
